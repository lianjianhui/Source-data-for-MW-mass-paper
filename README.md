# Source-data-for-MW-mass-paper
This repository includes the vertical and radial mass profiles presented in our paper on the stellar mass of the Milky Way (Lian et al. in prep).

The vertical mass profile in the solar neighborhood is included in density-dtr-sn-250615.fits. This file contains two HDU, the first HDU is 3D intrinsic density in unit of Msun/pc^3 with a shape of (357,6), where the first dimension is for the height and second dimension is for the densities in order of the living stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, and all together and the center of each height bin (kpc).
